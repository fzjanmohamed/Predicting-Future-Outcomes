# Predicting-Future-Outcomes
Assess knowledge and practice skills in building models for relating an exposure to future time-to-event outcomes, while considering the necessity or unnecessity of adjusting for covariates, including time-varying covariates
This study investigated bone structure of the ankle using a CT scanner. The investigators
are interested to see how pore size / spacing in the cortex (outer shell) of the bone
(cortical porosity: t_CtPo_EC) versus the pore size/ spacing in the trabecular (marrow
region) region of the bone (trabecular separation: t_TbSp), each relate to new
osteoporotic fractures over the next 3 years.
They are keen to demonstrate that these CT metrics can be used to estimate someoneâ€™s
future fracture risk, even after accounting for the current standard of care, which is DXA
bone mineral density (BMD) of the total hip (tothip_16).
